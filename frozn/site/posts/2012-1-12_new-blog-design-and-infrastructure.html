<p> A brand new year and a brand new blog design.</p>

<p>This blog is now a static site, powered by a custom static blog generator I wrote in Python called <a href="https://github.com/jasonbartz/frozn" target="_blank">Frozn</a></p>

<p>It's a work in progress, but I wanted to get it out there for the beginning part of the new year.</p>

<p>I've included one technical post from my old blog, which will soon be available at the archives when they are live, but for now, enjoy the design and the code.</p>

<p>Design powered by <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>

<p>Blog powered by <a href="https://github.com/jasonbartz/frozn" target="_blank">Frozn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2</a></p>
