A brand new year and a brand new blog design.

This blog is now a static site, powered by a custom static blog generator I wrote in Python called <a href="https://github.com/jasonbartz/frozn" target="_blank">Frozn</a>

It's a work in progress, but I wanted to get it out there for the beginning part of the new year.

I've included one technical post from my old blog, which will soon be available at the archives when they are live, but for now, enjoy the design and the code.

Design powered by <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.

Blog powered by <a href="https://github.com/jasonbartz/frozn" target="_blank">Frozn</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/">Jinja2</a>
